Overview

Polling Site is a project developed using Django and React that interacts with an API to facilitate polling functionality. The goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of API interactions, Celery for periodic tasks, and Docker for containerization.
Features

    Django Backend: Handles API requests and manages data.
    React Frontend: Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the polling system.
    Celery Integration: Enables periodic tasks for API interaction.
    Dockerized Environment: Ensures consistent development and production environments.


Challenges Encountered

    Celery and Docker Communication: Initially faced issues with Docker not communicating properly with the running Celery tasks. This was resolved by updating Docker settings.
    API Costs: Misread OpenAPI's pricing structure, which requires payment even for low-traffic requests. This led to pausing the project until I can rationalize the API purchase.

Future Plans

I am eager to resume this project once I can justify the costs associated with using the OpenAPI. Enhancements and new features will be implemented based on my learning experiences thus far.
